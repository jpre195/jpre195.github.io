          I am currently working as a data scientist within the Revenue Planning and Optimization organization for Walt Disney World.
          I am responsible for building and maintaining data science products that help create magic. I do this by using tools like
          Python, SQL, GitLab, streamlit, Tableau, and more. I'm also responsible for creating and ensuring quality of large-scale
          datasets for the organization to utilize for high priority analyses. This is accomplished by using tools like dbt for 
          modern data development and SODA for data quality.

          Biosurveillance Application team competition sponsored by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) to foster 
          novel and creative approaches for reducing chemical and biological threats. This was a summer internship competition 
          consisting of 3 diverse teams of 4 interns to work together to design and develop a fully functional Android application.
          The application was to be designed to inform warfighters to region-specific risk of infection for various diseases.
          Panel of domain experts judged each application for cash bonuses based on a range of criteria including (but not limited 
          to): overall user experience, model accuracy/effectiveness, and risk assessment. I developed the methodology and
          implementation of the control charts for risk assessment.
